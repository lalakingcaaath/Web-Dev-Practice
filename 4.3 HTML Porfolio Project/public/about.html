<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Jericho a recently graduate with a Diploma in Computer Engineering
  Technology. But I will still be pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
  Engineering which will take 2 or 3 more years.
</p>

<p>
  I am also an aspiring Front-End Developer and I hope that I can make it to the
  industry.
